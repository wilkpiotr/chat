# Simple Chat Application (SPA)
Vanilla js project based on webpack and babel. 

My job was: 
1. Create layout of login' page and chat's page
2. Routing login to server and getting responds with token (saved in session storage)
3. Handling adding and retrieving new massages
4. Refreshing page by setting SetInterval function
5. Make 'delete' button for owners of massage (which should be different than other messages).
6. All server requests have to own header Authorization.
